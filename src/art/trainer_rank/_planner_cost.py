"""Fitted integer cost model for prefix-tree layout selection.

The score is a lexicographic fixed-point tuple: predicted work first, then
packed tokens, segment count, and maximum depth as deterministic tie-breaks.
All terms are integers so every rank computes bit-identical scores.

Provenance (coefficient version 2): fitted 2026-09-02 from a forced-candidate
calibration campaign on H200 bf16 (``dev/trainer_rank_landing_acceptance.py
--phase cost-calibrate`` and ``dev/trainer_rank_cost_fit.py``): every
mandatory candidate layout of each cell timed through the public API (forward
+ backward through an active LoRA slot, compile-free, max-rank), on Qwen3.5-4B
(GDN, 24 of 32 layers) and Qwen3-4B (attention) at TP1/TP2 and CP1/CP2/CP4,
over hierarchical GRPO shapes, heterogeneous controls and real Ellavox groups.
Coefficients are a non-negative least-squares fit on within-cell paired timing
deltas, refined by direct regret minimization, fitted on 45 cells and
evaluated on all 56 (the 11 odd Ellavox groups are the pre-registered holdout;
whole topologies, shapes and models were withheld in ablations). The table is
bound to its evidence by ``dev/trainer_rank_cost_calibration_certificate_<table>.json``.
The version-1 constants they replace were hand-set, not fitted.

What the data showed: the cost of a shared prefix level is a GDN effect that
grows when the level's state hand-offs cross CP or TP ranks (the attention
model pays almost nothing for it), per-rank token work shrinks with tp x cp,
GDN layers cost more per token than attention layers, and segments that are
tiny *per rank* run inefficient kernels. Ten terms carried weight; candidates
that fitted to zero were dropped.
``COEFFICIENT_VERSION`` and the selected table's identity are part of every
layout cache key, so a new table invalidates cached recipes.

Calibrated domain: a table applies only to the execution classes it was
measured on — device class, parameter dtype, model geometry (widths, head
geometry, GDN state shape, expert geometry) and parallel shape (TP, CP, EP,
ETP) — see ``CalibratedTable`` and ``select_scoring``. Outside every table the
version-1 score applies.
